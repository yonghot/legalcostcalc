/**
 * ad-slots.ts — the single place this repo resolves an AdSense slot id
 * (부속W CODE-01).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Manual AdSense units are `<ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-slot="…">`
 * elements. Without a REAL numeric slot id there is nothing for AdSense to
 * fill, so every ad component renders nothing when its slot env var is unset —
 * correct behaviour (never ship an empty grey box), but it made the whole
 * portfolio silently unmonetizable: a live audit found ZERO
 * `<ins class="adsbygoogle">` elements across all 10 domains even though the
 * loader script and publisher meta tag were present (부속W §2.3).
 *
 * The aggravating factor was NAMING. Each repo invented its own env var
 * (firepath `_SLOT_RESULT`/`_SLOT_GUIDE`, LaunchCostCalc `_RESULT_SLOT`/
 * `_MID_SLOT` — the same concept with the words swapped, SaaSCostX and
 * DentalCostFinder `_SLOT_ID`), so setting a value in one Vercel project lit
 * up nothing in the others.
 *
 * CONTRACT (identical in every repo of the portfolio)
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_SLOT_ID` is the CANONICAL name. Set that one variable
 * and every placement in this repo resolves. Per-placement variables still win
 * when present, so existing deployments keep working unchanged.
 *
 * A slot id is only accepted when it looks like a real AdSense slot id
 * (`/^\d{6,}$/`). Anything else — a placement label like "rectangle", a
 * leftover "TODO", an empty string — resolves to `undefined` so the caller
 * renders no `<ins>` at all. A malformed `data-ad-slot` never fills; emitting
 * one only produces an invalid unit and a misleading empty ad region.
 *
 * NOTE: slot ids are NOT secrets. They ship in the rendered HTML, which is why
 * they are `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`.
